To create a Power BI project on "Crime Incidents in Los Angeles: 2020 to 2024," collect data from sources like the Kaggle from LAPD's crime reporting system. Clean and format the data, then build a dashboard to visualize crime trends, types, locations, and patterns over time using charts, heatmaps, and filters for interactive analysis.
